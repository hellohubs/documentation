Each Hello Hub has two computer  “terminals”, one server, one WiFi access point, one charging shelf, and one workbench.
 
The Internet terminals provide a computer workstation that any student or community member (or group of community members) can use for a wide range of activities. There are a wide range of educational applications built into the kiosk system, as well as standard applications such as an office suite, media editing tools etc. Each terminal will have a fixed bench seat, where up to 4 users can comfortably access the terminal at one time. Each terminal will also have a built-in camera (for still, video and web video conversations), microphone, and speakers.
The server's function is to load the system to the terminals, manage the Internet connection to the world, route traffic from the WiFi access point, conduct regular backups, provide administrative notifications about the health and status of the Hello Hub system, and record usage data for the community and its partners. (It should be noted that no recording of data will be conducted without the explicit consent of the community and users). 
 
Each Hello Hub will have a 24/7 WiFi access point providing an Internet connection for community members’ own devices, such as mobile phones, tablets, computers, or other devices that require WiFi access.
 
Each Hello Hub will have a built-in electronics workbench with equipment for the maintenance of the Hello Hub itself.  The workbench can also be used for community-led technical experimentation and innovation.
 
Internet connection will vary with each Hello Hub, depending on the location and options available. The kiosk is powered by an off-grid solar power system.
