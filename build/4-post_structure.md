## Overview

This module includes the parts list, design specification, and build description for a rapid build Hello Hub structure, using (readily available) 4-post server racks(link is external) (link is external) as the primary structural component.
Many of these racks have high strength specifications, offer modular mounting options, and can be shipped flat-packed (will be great for multiple-hub builds). They are generally a slightly smaller footprint than our current spec (3' x 2' instead of 3' x 3'), but this should be ok as we have been working hard to reduce the power consumption of the system and the result is that we have a reduced number of PV panels to hold up.
